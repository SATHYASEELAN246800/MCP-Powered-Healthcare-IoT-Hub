## 📌 Project Overview  

The **MCP-Powered Healthcare IoT Hub** is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that integrates **IoT devices, AI agents, ML/DL models, and consent-based data access** to solve today’s major healthcare challenges:  

- 🚑 **Reactive Care** → Patients are treated only after crises (heart attack, stroke, etc.)  
- 🔗 **Fragmented Systems** → IoT, EHR, and lab data remain in silos.  
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Clinician Overload** → Doctors waste time in manual chart review.  
- 🏥 **Rural Gaps** → Villages lack ICU-level continuous monitoring.  
- 🔐 **Data Privacy Issues** → Patients rarely control who can see their health data.  

This project provides **continuous monitoring, AI-driven early alerts, rural accessibility, and consent-driven privacy control** using modern AI/IoT integration.

## ⚙️ Technical Stack  

### 🔹 Languages & Libraries
- **Python 3** (Core)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data handling & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Health data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → Machine Learning (RandomForest for risk prediction)  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** → Deep Learning (Neural Network for classification)  
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** → AI Agents for summaries & clinical insights  

### 🔹 AI Agents (MCP Simulation)
